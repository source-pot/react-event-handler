# React-event-handler

Emit and handle events from anywhere in a React app.

The goal of this repo is to provide a simple implementation of a subscribable event system,
emit and handle events "the React way".

> Need to do more work on the Typescript side to make this look more elegant.

## Setup

* `pnpm install` (or any other package manager)
* `pnpm run dev`
* Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
* Read the code
